  This repo is help anyone that wishes to build a cheap distance sensor to determine if your garage door is open/closed and if your car is parked inside or not.</p>
<hr --- </hr>
<p align="left">The scope of this project was to create a sensor that could tell me if I have left my door open or not from within my home automation software "Home Assistant". Once intergrated into home assistant I could then set automations to close the door during my goodnight script if it was still open or close it if we are not home for more then 10mins.</p>
